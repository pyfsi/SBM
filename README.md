This repository contains the complete model used to define a transient inlet boundary condition to be used in a subsequent Volume-Of-Fluid (VOF) simulation. This model was coined the "Synthetic Bubble Model" (SBM).

The model constructs a virtual pre-domain in front of the actual domain's inlet and subsequently fills the pre-domain - initially filled with liquid - with gas bubbles of arbitrary shape and of random size, at a randomly chosen position in time and space. It is initially constructed for use in combination with OpenFOAM/4.1, but has been tested in OpenFOAM/6 as well. Moreover, the main modelling script is independent of flow solver to be used in the subsequent CFD simulation.

The complete user manual "inletmodelling_manual" is also given in this repository; this a technical manual, without explanation of the concept behind the model or the underlying algorithm. The latter are described in my Ph.D. dissertation, published in 2020 at Ghent University. You can find the full text [here](https://lib.ugent.be/catalog/rug01:002978914). The user manual is also in the appendix of my dissertation.
